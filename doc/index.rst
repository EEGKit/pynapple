      Pynapple is a light-weight python library for 
      neurophysiological data analysis. 

      The goal is to offer a versatile set of tools to 
      study typical data in the field, i.e. time series 
      (spike times, behavioral events, etc.) and time intervals 
      (trials, brain states, etc.). 

      It also provides users with generic functions for 
      neuroscience such as tuning curves and cross-correlograms.
